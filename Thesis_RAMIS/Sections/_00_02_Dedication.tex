  "The scientific theorist is not to be envied. For Nature, or more precisely experiment, is an exorable and not very friendly judge of his work. It never says 'yes' to a theory. In the most favorable cases it says 'Maybe', and in the great majority of cases simply 'No'. If an experiment agrees with a theory it means for the latter 'Maybe', and if it does not agree it means 'No'. Probably every theory will some day experience its 'No' - most theories, soon after conception."
