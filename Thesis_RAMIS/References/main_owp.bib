@article{xu_2017a,
	Abstract = {Based on the Markov model and the basic theory of information entropy, this paper puts forward a new method for optimizing the location of observation points in order to obtain more information from limited geological investigation. According to the existing data from observation points data, classification of tunnel geological lithology was performed, and various lithology distribution were determined along the tunnel using the Markov model and theory. On the basis of the information entropy theory, the distribution of information entropy was obtained along the axis of the tunnel. Therefore, different information entropy could be acquired by calculating different classification of rocks. Furthermore, uncertainty increases when information entropy increased. The maximum entropy indicates maximum uncertainty and thus, this value determines the position of the new drilling hole. A new geology situation will be decided by the maximum entropy for the lowest accuracy. Optimal distribution will be obtained after recalculating, using the new location of the geology situation. Taking the engineering for the Bashiyi Daban water diversion tunneling in Xinjiang as a case, the maximum information entropy of the geological conditions was analyzed by the method proposed in the present study, with 25 newly added geology observation points along the axis of the 30-km tunnel. The results proved the validity of the present method. The method and results in this paper may be used not only to predict the geological conditions of underground engineering based on the investigated geological information, but also to optimize the distribution of the geology observation points.},

	Abstract = {The work presented herein addresses the problem of sensor placement optimization in urban water distribution networks by use of an entropy-based approach, for the purpose of efficient and economically viable waterloss incident detection. The proposed method is applicable to longitudinal rather than spatial sensing, thus to devices such as acoustic, pressure, or flow sensors acting on pipe segments. The method utilizes the maximality, subadditivity and equivocation properties of entropy, coupled with a statistical definition of the probability of sensing within a pipe segment, to assign an entropy metric to each pipe segment and subsequently optimize the location of sensors in the network based on maximizing the total entropy in the network. The method proposed is a greedy-search heuristic. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2013},

@article{abellan_2010a,
	Abstract = {Oil and gas reservoirs or subsurface aquifers are complex heterogeneous natural structures. They are characterized by means of several direct or indirect field measurements involving different physical processes operating at various spatial and temporal scales. For example, drilling wells provides small plugs whose physical properties may be measured in the laboratory. At a larger scale, seismic techniques provide a characterization of the geological structures. In some cases these techniques can help characterize the spatial fluid distribution, whose knowledge can in turn be used to improve the oil recovery strategy. In practice, these measurements are always expensive. In addition, due to their indirect and incomplete character, the measurements cannot give an exhaustive description of the reservoir and several uncertainties still remain. Quantification of these uncertainties is essential when setting up a reservoir development scenario and when modelling the risks due to the cost of the associated field operations. Within this framework, devising strategies that allow one to set up optimal data acquisition schemes can have many applications in oil or gas reservoir engineering, or in the CO2 geological storages. In this paper we present a method allowing us to quantify the information that is potentially provided by any set of measurements. Using a Bayesian framework, the information content of any set of data is defined by using the Kullback--Leibler divergence between posterior and prior density distributions. In the case of a Gaussian model where the data depends linearly on the parameters, explicit formulae are given. The kriging example is treated, which allows us to find an optimal well placement. The redundancy of data can also be quantified, showing the role of the correlation structure of the prior model. We extend the approach to the permeability estimation from a well-test simulation using the apparent permeability. In this case, the global optimization result of the mean information criterion gives an optimal acquisition time frequency.},

@phdthesis{magnant_2011a,
	Abstract = {The two goals of this thesis are to develop numerical methods for solving large-scale optimal experimental design problems efficiently and to apply optimal experimental design ideas to applications in regularization techniques and geophysics. The thesis can be divided into three parts. In the first part, we consider the problem of experimental design for linear ill-posed inverse problems. The minimization of the objective function in the classic A-optimal design is generalized to a Bayes risk minimization with a sparsity constraint. We present efficient algorithms for applications of such designs to large-scale problems. This is done by employing Krylov subspace methods for the solution of a subproblem required to obtain the experiment weights. The performance of the designs and algorithms is illustrated with a one-dimensional magnetotelluric example and an application to two-dimensional super-resolution reconstruction with MRI data. In the second part, we find the optimal regularization for linear ill-posed problems. We propose an optimal ℓ2 regularization approach enabling us to obtain inexpensive and good solutions to the inverse problem. In order to reduce the computational cost, several sparsity patterns are added to the regularization operator. Numerical experiments will show that our optimal ℓ 2 regularization approach provides much better results than the traditional Tikhonov regularization. In the last part of the thesis, we design optimal placement of sources and receivers in a CO2 injection monitoring. An optimal criteria is proposed based on a target zone and different treatments for placing sources and receivers are discussed.},

	Abstract = {Simulating fields of categorical geospatial variables from samples is crucial for many purposes, such as spatial uncertainty assessment of natural resources distributions. However, effectively simulating complex categorical variables (i.e., multinomial classes) is difficult because of their nonlinearity and complex interclass relationships. The existing pure Markov chain approach for simulating multinomial classes has an apparent deficiency---underestimation of small classes, which largely impacts the usefulness of the approach. The Markov chain random field (MCRF) theory recently proposed supports theoretically sound multi-dimensional Markov chain models. This paper conducts a comparative study between a MCRF model and the previous Markov chain model for simulating multinomial classes to demonstrate that the MCRF model effectively solves the small-class underestimation problem. Simulated results show that the MCRF model fairly produces all classes, generates simulated patterns imitative of the original, and effectively reproduces input transiograms in realizations. Occurrence probability maps are estimated to visualize the spatial uncertainty associated with each class and the optimal prediction map. It is concluded that the MCRF model provides a practically efficient estimator for simulating multinomial classes from grid samples.},

publisher={Springer International Publishing},
address={Cham},
pages={77-90},
abstract={The paper considers several optimization problem statements for sparse signal reconstruction problems. We tested the performance of AORDA portfolio safeguard (PSG) package with different problem formulations. We solved several medium-size test problems with cardinality functions: (a) minimize L1-error of regression subject to a constraint on cardinality of the solution vector; (b) minimize cardinality of the solution vector subject to a constraint on L1-error of regression. We compared performance of PSG and IBM CPLEX solvers on these problems. Although cardinality formulations are very appealing because of the direct control of the number of nonzero variables, large problems are beyond the reach of the tested commercial solvers. Step-down from the cardinality formulations is the formulation with the constraint on the sum of absolute values of the solution vector. This constraint is a relaxation of the cardinality constraint. Medium and large problems (from SPARCO toolbox for testing sparse reconstruction algorithms) were solved with PSG in the following formulation: minimize L1-error subject to a constraint on the sum of absolute values of the solution vector. The further step-down in the sparse reconstruction problem formulations is the LASSO approach which does not have any constraints on functions. With the LASSO approach you do not know in advance the cardinality of the solution vector and you solve many problems with different regularization parameters. Then you select a solution with appropriate regression error and cardinality. Definitely, it is a time-consuming process, but an advantage of LASSO approach is that optimization problems can be solved quite quickly even for very large problems. We have solved with PSG several medium and large problems from the SPARCO toolbox in LASSO formulation (minimize L2-error plus the weighted sum of absolute values of the solution vector).},

volume={52},

abstract={This paper considers the model problem of reconstructing an object from incomplete frequency samples. Consider a discrete-time signal f∈CN and a randomly chosen set of frequencies Ω. Is it possible to reconstruct f from the partial knowledge of its Fourier coefficients on the set Ω? A typical result of this paper is as follows. Suppose that f is a superposition of |T| spikes f(t)=στ∈Tf(τ)δ(t-τ) obeying |T|≤CM·(log N)-1 · |Ω| for some constant CM>0. We do not know the locations of the spikes nor their amplitudes. Then with probability at least 1-O(N-M), f can be reconstructed exactly as the solution to the ℓ1 minimization problem. In short, exact recovery may be obtained by solving a convex optimization problem. We give numerical values for CM which depend on the desired probability of success. Our result may be interpreted as a novel kind of nonlinear sampling theorem. In effect, it says that any signal made out of |T| spikes may be recovered by convex programming from almost every set of frequencies of size O(|T|·logN). Moreover, this is nearly optimal in the sense that any method succeeding with probability 1-O(N-M) would in general require a number of frequency samples at least proportional to |T|·logN. The methodology extends to a variety of other situations and higher dimensions. For example, we show how one can reconstruct a piecewise constant (one- or two-dimensional) object from incomplete frequency samples - provided that the number of jumps (discontinuities) obeys the condition above - by minimizing other convex functionals such as the total variation of f.},

An l 1 - minimization reconstruction algorithm is proposed, and a performance guaranteed result is adopted to evaluate its reconstruction. From this analysis, we formulate the problem of basis selection, where it is shown that for unstructured pixel-based measurements the Discrete Cosine Transform is the best choice for the problem. In the experimental side, signal-to-noise ratios and similarity perceptual indicators are used to evaluate the quality of the reconstructions, and promising reconstruction results are obtained. The potential of this new approach is demonstrated in under-sampled scenario of $2–4$ \% of direct data, which is known to be very challenging in the absence of prior knowledge from a training image.

@article{Scheidt2009_a,
	abstract = {
Assessing uncertainty of a spatial phenomenon requires the analysis of a large number of parameters which must be processed by a transfer function. To capture the possibly of a wide range of uncertainty in the transfer function response, a large set of geostatistical model realizations needs to be processed. Stochastic spatial simulation can rapidly provide multiple, equally probable realizations. However, since the transfer function is often computationally demanding, only a small number of models can be evaluated in practice, and are usually selected through a ranking procedure. Traditional ranking techniques for selection of probabilistic ranges of response (P10, P50 and P90) are highly dependent on the static property used. In this paper, we propose to parameterize the spatial uncertainty represented by a large set of geostatistical realizations through a distance function measuring “dissimilarity” between any two geostatistical realizations. The distance function allows a mapping of the space of uncertainty. The distance can be tailored to the particular problem. The multi-dimensional space of uncertainty can be modeled using kernel techniques, such as kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) or kernel clustering. These tools allow for the selection of a subset of representative realizations containing similar properties to the larger set. Without losing accuracy, decisions and strategies can then be performed applying a transfer function on the subset without the need to exhaustively evaluate each realization. This method is applied to a synthetic oil reservoir, where spatial uncertainty of channel facies is modeled through multiple realizations generated using a multi-point geostatistical algorithm and several training images.

@inproceedings{Strebelle_2004a,
abstract = {During the last few years, the use of multiple-point statistics simulation to model depositional facies has become increasingly popular in the oil industry. In contrast to conventional variogram-based techniques such as sequential indicator simulation, multiple-point geostatistics enables the generation of facies models that capture key depositional elements (e.g. curvilinear channels) characterized by unique and predictable shapes. In addition, multiple-point geostatistics is more intuitive because the complex mathematical expression of the variogram is replaced with an explicit three-dimensional training image that depicts the geometrical characteristics of the expected facies. In multiple-point geostatistics, the stationarity assumption that underlies the inference of a variogram model from sparse sample data is extended to infer facies joint-correlation statistics from the training image. A consequence of this assumption is that patterns extracted from the training image can be reproduced in any region of the reservoir model where the training image is thought to be representative of the geological heterogeneity. Yet actual reservoirs are generally non-stationary: topographic constraints, sea-level cycles, or changes of sedimentation sources lead to spatial variations of facies deposition directions and facies geobody dimensions. Three-dimensional fields of location-dependent facies azimuth/dimensions representing those spatial variations are commonly estimated from well log and seismic data, or from geological interpretations based on analogs. This paper proposes a modification of the multiple-point statistics simulation program snesim to account for such non-stationary information. In the oriainal snesim, prior to the simulation, the multiple-point-point statistics inferred from the training image are stored in a dynamic data structure called a search tree. In the presence of a locally-varying azimuth field, the range of possible azimuths over the study field is first discretized into a small number of classes. Then, the training image is successively rotated by the average value of each azimuth class and a search tree is built for each resulting rotated training image. During the simulation, at each unsampled node, multiple-point statistics are retrieved from the search tree built for the class in which the local azimuth falls, enabling the local reproduction of patterns similar to those of the corresponding rotated training image. A similar process is proposed to account for a field of location-dependent facies geobody dimensions. The new modified snesim program is applied to the simulation of a fluvial reservoir with locally-variable channel orientations and widths.},

abstract = {An entirely new approach to stochastic simulation is proposed through the direct simulation of patterns. Unlike pixel-based (single grid cells) or object-based stochastic simulation, pattern-based simulation simulates by pasting patterns directly onto the simulation grid. A pattern is a multi-pixel configuration identifying a meaningful entity (a puzzle piece) of the underlying spatial continuity. The methodology relies on the use of a training image from which the pattern set (database) is extracted. The use of training images is not new. The concept of a training image is extensively used in simulating Markov random fields or for sequentially simulating structures using multiple-point statistics. Both these approaches rely on extracting statistics from the training image, then reproducing these statistics in multiple stochastic realizations, at the same time conditioning to any available data. The proposed approach does not rely, explicitly, on either a statistical or probabilistic methodology. Instead, a sequential simulation method is proposed that borrows heavily from the pattern recognition literature and simulates by pasting at each visited location along a random path a pattern that is compatible with the available local data and any previously simulated patterns. This paper discusses the various implementation details to accomplish this idea. Several 2D illustrative as well as realistic and complex 3D examples are presented to showcase the versatility of the proposed algorithm.},

abstract = { We describe a technique for image encoding in which local operators of many scales but identical shape serve as the basis functions. The representation differs from established techniques in that the code elements are localized in spatial frequency as well as in space.  Pixel-to-pixel correlations are first removed by subtracting a lowpass filtered copy of the image from the image itself. The result is a net data compression since the difference, or error, image has low variance and entropy, and the low-pass filtered image may represented at reduced sample density. Further data compression is achieved by quantizing the difference image. These steps are then repeated to compress the low-pass image. Iteration of the process at appropriately expanded scales generates a pyramid data structure.  The encoding process is equivalent to sampling the image with Laplacian operators of many scales. Thus, the code tends to enhance salient image features. A further advantage of the present code is that it is well suited for many image analysis tasks as well as for image compression. Fast algorithms are described for coding and decoding.},

@phdthesis{GuyagulerBaris2002_a,
abstract = {Determining the best location for new wells is a complex problem that depends on reservoir and fluid properties, well and surface equipment specifications, and economic criteria. Various approaches have been proposed for this problem. Among those, direct optimization using the simulator as the evaluation function, although accurate, is in most cases infeasible due to the number of simulations required. This study proposes a hybrid optimization technique (HGA) based on the genetic algorithm (GA) with helper functions based on the polytope algorithm and the kriging algorithm. Hybridization of the GA with these helper methods introduces hill-climbing into the stochastic search and also makes use of proxies created and calibrated iteratively throughout the run, following the idea of using cheap substitutes for the expensive numerical simulation. Performance of the technique was investigated by optimizing placement of injection wells in the Gulf of Mexico Pompano field. A single realization of the reservoir was used. It was observed from controlled experiments that the number of simulations required to find optimal well configurations was reduced significantly. This reduction in the number of simulations enabled the use of full-scale simulation for optimization even for this full-scale field problem. Well configuration and injection rate were optimized with net present value maximization of the waterflooding project as the objective. The optimum development plan for another real world reservoir located in the Middle East was investigated. Optimization using the numerical simulator as the evaluation function for the field posed significant challenges since the model has half a million cells. The GA was setup in parallel on four processors to speed up the optimization process. The optimal deployment schedule of 13 predrilled wells that would meet the production target specified by the operating company was sought. The problem was formulated as a traveling salesman problem and the order of wells in the drilling queue was optimized. Ways to assess the uncertainty in the proposed reservoir development plan were also investigated since we never possess the exhaustive information about the true reservoir but rather we may have geostatistical realizations of the truth constructed from the information available. An approach that can translate the uncertainty in the data to uncertainty in terms of monetary value was developed. In this study the uncertainties associated with well placement were addressed within the utility theory framework using numerical simulation as the evaluation tool. The HGA was used to reduce the computational burden of making numerous numerical simulations. The methodology was evaluated using the PUNQ-S3 model, which is a standard test case that was based on a real field and was used for the PUNQ project in context of the EU-Joule program. Experiments were carried on 23 history-matched realizations and a truth case was also available. The results were verified by comparison to exhaustive simulations. Utility theory not only offered the framework to quantify the influence of uncertainties in the reservoir description in terms of monetary value but also provided the tools to quantify the otherwise arbitrary notion of the risk attitude of the decision maker},

    abstract = {{Abstract\&nbsp;\&nbsp;Determining} the optimum type and location of new wells is an essential component in the efficient development of oil and gas fields. The optimization problem is, however, demanding due to the potentially high dimension of the search space and the computational requirements associated with function evaluations, which, in this case, entail full reservoir simulations. In this paper, the particle swarm optimization ({PSO}) algorithm is applied for the determination of optimal well type and location. The {PSO} algorithm is a stochastic procedure that uses a population of solutions, called particles, which move in the search space. Particle positions are updated iteratively according to particle fitness (objective function value) and position relative to other particles. The general {PSO} procedure is first discussed, and then the particular variant implemented for well optimization is described. Four example cases are considered. These involve vertical, deviated, and dual-lateral wells and optimization over single and multiple reservoir realizations. For each case, both the {PSO} algorithm and the widely used genetic algorithm ({GA}) are applied to maximize net present value. Multiple runs of both algorithms are performed and the results are averaged in order to achieve meaningful comparisons. It is shown that, on average, {PSO} outperforms {GA} in all cases considered, though the relative advantages of {PSO} vary from case to case. Taken in total, these findings are very promising and demonstrate the applicability of {PSO} for this challenging problem.},

It works as a possible exploration tool for the Miocene gas accumulations in the Carpathian Foredeep of Poland. Deterministic and stochastic, geostatistical methods were used to construct a static reservoir model from 2D seismic sections, lithological data and hydraulic flow unit data. A pseudo-3D seismic volume was generated from all of the 2D seismic data available, in order to aid the modelling of hydraulic flow units. This approach is applicable to other reservoirs, where the availability of seismic data is limited. This study demonstrates that even without 3D seismic data and with limited well log data, the proposed hydraulic flow unit approach can be successfully applied to reservoir modelling through the integration of diverse data sets for a wide range of scales.},

This study successfully addresses compartmentalisation due to highly variable lithofacies by analysing geophysical well-logs, lithofacies modelling, and 3D seismic attributes including time thickness, amplitude, and structural time maps. In the light of some discouraging drilling results at Weirman Field, we recommend a revised approach to prospect evaluation, based upon a newly interpreted palaeodepositional setting, to predict the distribution of clean sand facies, using a combination of seismic attribute signatures and structural closure maps. In support of our interpretation, we compare the proposed palaeodepositional setting with a modern analogue of a transitional coastal to shallow marine depositional environment. The dimensions and spatial relationships of the interpreted geo-bodies are in conformity with the modern shoreline analogues of a barrier beach or strandplain adjacent to an estuary. The lithofacies clustering was calibrated to a lithostratigraphic column, which was constructed based on drilling-cuttings of Wanda Judeen No. 1. This calibration was upheld against correlation with well-logs for other wells. "}

abstract = "Abstract Core data are commonly used to calibrate reservoir parameters with wireline logs, so that the log data can be used to propagate the reservoir properties over the zone of interest or into three-dimensional reservoir models. However, such a calibration is often suboptimal, either because it is built without incorporating basic tenets of statistical modeling or built with biased samples. We discuss pitfalls in calibration between data from different sources (e.g., core, log, and seismic) using linear regression because it is the most commonly used modeling method. Many of the problems with fitting a regression model between core analyses, wireline logs, and/or seismic data can often be mitigated in the sample selection process. It is advantageous to choose samples with limited bias, and in a manner that accounts for the heterogeneity inherent in most unconventional reservoirs. By acknowledging both the assumptions inherent in statistical modeling and the formation heterogeneity, one can collect the data necessary for construction of a calibration model efficiently without necessarily requiring more samples. To achieve this, it is useful to deconstruct the log response into zones of similar bulk material properties, and then sample each zone in a relevant manner. "

title = {SOFI of GABA$_b$ neurotransmitter receptors in hippocampal neurons elucidates intracellular receptor trafficking and assembly},
volume = {8590},
abstract = {The synaptic efficacy of neurons depends on the number of neurotransmitter receptors in the plasma membrane. The
availability of these receptors is controlled by their specific intracellular trafficking routes. γ-Aminobutyric acid type B
receptors (GABABRs) are heteromeric proteins consisting of GABA<sub>B</sub>R1 and GABA<sub>B</sub>R2 subunits. These receptors are
found at the plasma membrane of somatodendritic postsynaptic sites and in axons.
It is unknown whether the assembly of the subunits occurs directly in the somatic endoplasmic reticulum (ER) followed
by vesicular transport, or whether the assembly occurs after the separate transport of the subunits to the dendritic ER
compartment.
To address this question we have studied the assembly of the GABA<sub>B</sub>Rs in hippocampal neurons with dual-color, 3D
super-resolution optical fluctuation imaging (SOFI). SOFI is a fluorescence imaging modality which yields superresolved
spatial resolution, 3D-sectioning and high image contrast. We will use the SOFI images to quantify the
distribution of the GABA<sub>B</sub>R subunits in the plasma membrane and in the dendritic intracellular compartments. Finally,
we want to apply quantitative co-localization analysis to determine the compartments in which the assembly of the
GABA<sub>B</sub>R subunits occurs.},
